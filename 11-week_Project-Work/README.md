Tim Holley, Tio, 2009

Tio is designed to teach children not to waste energy. Increasing the younger generation’s awareness of energy consumption now will help to effect change in the future. Focusing on lighting is a simple way to engage them. Tio enables children to demonstrate their knowledge of energy conservation to their families, while encouraging their role as ‘energy champions’ of the home.

Gerard Rallo, Expression Dispatcher, 2009

Gerard Rallo has made a series of communication Devices. Expressions Dispatcher is designed to help people in their quest for expressiveness. In using the device we can shift expressive responsibility and place it in the hands of an expert. [Visit his full website](http://www.gerardrallo.net/#art_design)

**The moral of the story is**
We don't have to get very complicated to create a big impact with design... as Mileha Soneji says ["Simple Solutions are often best"](https://www.ted.com/talks/mileha_soneji_simple_hacks_for_life_with_parkinson_s?language=en)

## Project 2

Project two should involve a process of moving from some physical input to digital and then back to a physical output. If you find that you would like to reverse that flow, it's ok to go from digital to physical to digital. I encourage you to use grasshopper, doing self guided research, and building on what you have learned so far. Using at least one tool learned this semester is required.

Timeline:
