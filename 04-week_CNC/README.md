## Today
- Look at 3D prints
- Take photo and upload it to your Assignment 2 folder
- CNC demo
- Setting up toolpaths
- 30-45 minutes to draw your CNC assignment
- Pair up and set toolpaths
- If possible, cut! //
- Begin working on Project 1, thinking, making sketches and modeling in Rhino

## CNC Assignment

- Make a shape that fits comfortably within 12" x  12"
- Draw or write something simple in that shape using only 2D lines and curves (keep it simple to save time)
- Pair up with the person sitting next to you and combine your files so that they both fit on a 24" x 48"  piece of plywood that is .47" thick (don't trust me though; measure for yourself)
- Work together as you set up toolpaths (two heads are better than one). One person can set one toolpath and one can set another.
- Create a toolpath to cut the perimeter shape profile out completely using the 1/4" Compression tool
- Create a toolpath to engrave the interior word or drawing .08" deep using the 1/4" ballnose tool

## The Weeks Ahead:

Sep. 27: Visiting Artist, Eduardo Corral // Project work day
Oct. 4: Finish CNC cuts if necessary / Project 1 work day
Oct. 11: Project 1 Work day
Oct. 18: Project 1 Critique


## Project 1

Use at least two of the three machines learned in the first part of class. Design something that enhances the display of an artwork that you have previously made or want to make. How can you make something that holds or accompanies your work but also serves to tie in the concept or formal aspects? You are striving for an overall cohesion with the object and the way that it is exhibited. For an added challenge, two parts must nest or fit together snuggly.

## Homework

- Begin working on Project 1, thinking, making sketches and modeling in Rhino
- Review [RhinoCAM 2015 Mill Reference](https://mecsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RhinoCAM_2015_MILL-Reference_Sample.pdf)
- Optional reading if you really want to understand CNC operations better: [Six Key Concepts Needed to Master CNC Programming](https://www.pmpa.org/docs/default-source/technical-conference/pdf-handout83ead2ae46706df9a22bff0000aff8c6.pdf?sfvrsn=0)
- REMINDER: NEXT WEEK, I will be gone, but I have an artist scheduled to come give a talk. Please sign in with Margaret, who will be on duty in the lab. I would also like for you to send me a project statement, a screenshot or saved image of preparatory sketches or models, as well as any questions that may have popped up, by 8pm Sep. 27th. **This email that you will send is how I will count your presence and participation for that day!** Caleb & Margaret will be on duty in the lab if you have any questions and need immediate help, but I will also try to be available by email as much as possible.
