# Expanded Design
This hands-on course introduces students to a variety of topics related to expanded design, prototyping and interactivity through tutorials, collaborative experimentation and guided studio time. The course will survey design-centric techniques to utilize 3d software, coding with Processing, physical computing with Arduino and time-based media for web. Students will learn how to prepare files for digital fabrication and prototyping. The course will enhance studentsâ€™ understanding of design processes as tools for experimentation, collaboration and reaching new audiences. Students will come out of this class with projects and skills that help to bridge the digital screen based world with physical design objects. Guest lectures and readings will provide a cultural and technical framework projects. This course is open to novices and to those seeking to expand their practice.

## Important Things to Remember
 - WHEN IN DOUBT, ASK!
 - Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
 - Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
 - Participation is integral to this class's culture. This also means coming prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
 -  Share what you learn along the way and feel free to collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
 - You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.
